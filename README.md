# Send Mail Project

This repository hosts the **Send Mail Project**, which sets up a server for sending emails via a REST API. The project includes an OAuth 2.0 authentication system and several API endpoints to manage email requests.

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**  
   - When you run the project, it starts a server and provides a URL for authentication.  
   - You need to authenticate using one of the test emails configured in the Google Cloud Console (GCC) OAuth 2.0 credentials.  

   **Note:**  
   If you'd like to test this project, please provide me with your email so I can add it to the list of test emails.  

   **Why Only Test Emails?**  
   Moving this project to production to support all users is technically possible, but it involves significant challenges. If you're curious about these challenges, feel free to contact me.

2. **Post-Authentication**  
   - After completing the authentication process, the server shuts down automatically, or you can stop it manually.  
   - Restart the server to access the API endpoints for sending email requests.
